## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Question 2
We are revisiting Question 3 from homework 1, but this time using R and presenting the results with R Markdown.
To start, we are creating a specific data frame


```{r}
x<- c(1,2,4,6,7,8,10)
y<- c(10,14,12,13,15,12,13)

#Combine vectors into data frame
df<- data.frame(x=x, y=y)

#Print the data frama
print(df)

```

## Question 4

Apply the knowledge from question3 to compute the following using R:
(i) Sxx, Sxy and Syy
```{r}
# Manual computing
Sxx=sum(x*x)-length(x)*mean(x)^2
Sxy=sum(x*y)-length(x)*mean(x)*mean(y)
Syy=sum(y*y)-length(x)*mean(y)^2

beta1hat=Sxy/Sxx
betaOhat=mean(y)-beta1hat*mean(x)

#Print betaOhat and beta1hat
print(paste("betaOhat = ",betaOhat))
print(paste("beta1hat = ",beta1hat))

#abline(a,b) adds a line with y-intercept as a and slope as b
plot(x,y)
abline(betaOhat,beta1hat)
```


## Question 5
```{r}
df<-read.csv("Advertising.csv",header=TRUE, sep=",")
x1<-df$TV
x2<-df$radio
x3<-df$newspaper
y<-df$sales


model1<-lm(y ~ x1)
options(digits = 9)
summary(model1)
plot(x1,y)
abline(model1)

model2<-lm(y ~ x2)
options(digits = 9)
summary(model2)
plot(x2,y)
abline(model2)


model3<-lm(y~x3)
summary(model3)
plot(x3,y)
abline(model3)

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
