MATH 484/564: Regression ‚Äì Fall 2024

This repository contains my assignments, notes, and projects for MATH 484/564: Regression, offered by the Department of Applied Mathematics at Illinois Institute of Technology.

The course introduces foundational methods in statistical learning and regression modeling. Topics include linear regression, logistic regression, resampling methods, model accuracy assessment, regularization, and more‚Äîall with a strong emphasis on using R for data analysis.

All coursework is based on the following open-access textbook:

Textbook: An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)
Authors: Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani
