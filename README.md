# MATH 484/564: Regression – Fall 2024

This repository contains my **assignments, notes, and projects** for **MATH 484/564: Regression**, offered by the **Department of Applied Mathematics at Illinois Institute of Technology**.

The course introduces foundational methods in **statistical learning and regression modeling**. Topics include linear regression, logistic regression, resampling methods, model accuracy assessment, regularization, and more — all with a strong emphasis on using **R** for data analysis.

All coursework is based on the following open-access textbook:

> **Textbook**: *An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)*  
> **Authors**: Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani
